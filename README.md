## Introduction

In this notebook, we will explore a dataset containing information about house sales in King County, USA. The primary goal is to understand the factors affecting house prices and build a predictive model to estimate the prices of houses based on these factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains various attributes of houses sold in King County, USA. The dataset includes features such as:

- ID
- Date
- Price
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Sqft_living
- Sqft_lot
- Floors
- Waterfront
- View
- Condition
- Grade
- Sqft_above
- Sqft_basement

- Sqft_lot15

## Data Cleaning

In this section, we perform data cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct any inconsistencies in the dataset. This step is crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset. Various visualizations and statistical techniques are used to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships with the target variable, house prices.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. In this section, we derive new features from the existing data and transform variables as needed.

## Modeling

Multiple machine learning models are applied to predict house prices. Models used may include:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are employed to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The best-performing model is selected based on these evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion

The notebook concludes with a summary of findings, key insights from the analysis, and potential areas for future work. Recommendations for stakeholders based on the analysis are also provided.
